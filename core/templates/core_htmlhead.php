/**
 * 	STOP! HAMMER TIME!
 *
 * ====> READ THIS !!!!!
 *
 * I really really, REALLY suggest you don't edit this file.
 * Why? This is the "main header" file where I put changes for updates.
 * And you don't want to have to manually go through and figure those out.
 *
 * That equals headache for you, and headache for me to figure out what went wrong.
 *
 * BUT BUT WAIT, you say... I want to include more javascript, css, etc...!
 * Well - in your skin's header.tpl file, this file is included as:
 *
 * Template::Show('core_htmlhead.tpl');
 *
 * Just add your stuff under that line there. That way, it's in the proper
 * spot, and this file stays intact for the system (and me) to be able to
 * make clean updates whenever needed. Less bugs = happy users (and happy me)
 *
 * THANKS!
