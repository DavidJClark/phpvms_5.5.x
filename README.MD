**--------------------------------_CAUTION_------------------------------------------**

If you have modules and other addons that worked in version 5.5.2 or older releases of phpVMS they will most likely break in this
version. There are numerous changes to make this version php 7.2 compatible. It is suggested you look through the commits of this
version and that of your currently installed phpVMS version prior to installing. **It is suggested that you NOT install to your 
live website environment until you complete any module and addon updates in a development environment.** Additionally, do NOT tie this
installation directly to your present database - create a new database for this install (you can transfer data over AFTER all your
modules and addons are working correctly.

**---------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

**INSTALLATION**

Upload to your development environment, create a database. Run the installer in .../install/install.php

This version is not for the faint of heart. If you have modules and other addons that worked on older releases of phpVMS they will most likely break in this version. There are numerous changes. I HIGHLY suggest you look through the commits on both the original phpVMS github repository as well as this one prior to updating. The phpVMS forum also holds a lot of information about using phpVMS and modules in php versions past 5.3.
