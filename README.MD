***Work in progress to make installation compliant with "Strict Mode" for use with MySQL 5.7 and MariaDB 10.2 and newer versions.***

** *****Use is at your own risk. Do not use if you don't understand the implications of "Strict Mode".***** **
**For use in new installations only. You can not install and then marry to a database used with previous versions.
You may be able to import just the data from your old database into the newly created database from this install. Do NOT import the structure from your old database. Many field DEFAULT values have been added.**

**--------------------------------_CAUTION_------------------------------------------**

If you have modules and other addons that worked in version 5.5.2 or older releases of phpVMS they will most likely break in this
version. There are numerous changes to make this version php 7.2 compatible. It is suggested you look through the commits of this
version and that of your currently installed phpVMS version prior to installing. **It is suggested that you NOT install to your 
live website environment until you complete any module and addon updates in a development environment.** Additionally, do NOT tie this
installation directly to your present database - create a new database for this install (you can transfer data over AFTER all your
modules and addons are working correctly.

**---------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

**INSTALLATION**

Upload to your development environment, create a database. Run the installer in .../install/install.php
